You are a monarch, like your parents before you - a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes...dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers, and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums - all small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these unfortunates, uniting them under your banner.

But wait. It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible while you can, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.

This is a game of building a deck of cards. The deck represents your Dominion. It contains your resources, victory points, and the things you can do. It starts out a small sad collection of Estates and Coppers, but you hope that by the end of the game it will be brimming with Gold, Provinces, and the inhabitants and structures of your castle and kingdom. You win by having

Before the first game, carefully place the cards in the organizer tray - do not shuffle them! Please note that some cards have different backs than others. The playing cards (Treasure cards, Victory cards, Curse cards, and Kingdom cards) all have a back with a tan border:

The Randomizer cards all have blue borders:

Do not mix the playing cards with the Randomizer cards. Place the Organizing Inlay in the middle of the Plastic organizer tray (placed such that the largest storage space is on the left) with Artisan at the top of the plastic tray.

Now unwrap the card decks and place the cards in the slots of the Plastic organizer tray next to the matching names on the Organizing Inlay. When playing a game, you will remove only the cards used in that game and then return them to their appropriate slots after each game. By doing so, you will always be able to easily and quickly set up a new game.

## Dominionrules.Qxp_Widedominion // : Am Page 

Each player takes 3 Estates and 7 Coppers and shuffles them face down as a starting deck.

Place 17 face-up piles of cards on the table: the 7 Base card piles, which are always used, and always the same, and 10 Kingdom card piles, which vary from game to game. The full set of cards available this game is called the Supply.

The Base cards are Copper, Silver, Gold, Estate, Duchy, Province, and Curse. • Copper, Silver, Gold: Use every copy you have of these (except Coppers players already have). • Estate, Duchy, Province: Use 8 copies of each for a 2-player game, 12 copies for 3-4 players. • Curse: Use 10 with 2 players, 20 with 3 players, all 30 with 4 players.

There are 26 Kingdom cards. If you have expansions, you can use those Kingdom cards as well. Choose 10 Kingdom cards to use, however you like; the others will not be used this game. You can pick the Kingdom cards randomly by shuffling the randomizer cards - the cards with the blue framed backs - and turning over 10 of them. There are a few pre-made sets of 10 cards in the Recommended Sets section that you can try. For your very first game of Dominion, use these cards: Cellar, Market, Merchant, Militia, Mine, Moat, Remodel, Smithy, Village, Workshop.

Whichever 10 cards you pick, get out those piles - 10 copies of each card (do not put the randomizer card in the pile). When a Victory Kingdom card is used (e.g. Gardens), it gets 8 copies for 2 players, 12 copies for 3-4 players, as with the other Victory cards.

Put the Trash mat near the piles.

## Dominionrules.Qxp_Widedominion // : Am Page 

Randomly choose a starting player. If you have just played a game of Dominion and it was not a tie, have the player who won the previous game go last (the player to their left goes first).

Each player draws an initial hand of 5 cards.

Dominion is a game of building a deck of cards. Each player has their own deck, their own discard pile, their own hand of cards and play area. Players start with a weak initial deck and gradually acquire better cards over the course of the game.

Players take turns. Each turn has three phases: Action, then Buy, then Clean-up, which you can remember as ABC. In the Action phase, you can play one Action card from your hand; in the Buy phase, you can play any number of Treasure cards and then buy one card to add to your deck; and in Clean-up you sweep up all of your cards from play and from your hand and discard them, then draw a new hand of 5 cards, shuffling as needed.

The game ends after 3 piles are empty or the Province pile is empty; then players count up the of their cards, and the player with the most

## Wins.

## On All

In your Action phase, you can play one Action card from your hand. Those are cards that say "Action" on the bottom, and by default have a white banner (some are other colors due to additional types). Playing an Action card has three steps: announcing it; moving it to the "in play" area - the table space in front of you; and following the instructions on it, in order, top to bottom. If the card has a dividing line (e.g. Moat), you stop there; instructions below the line happen at some other time (indicated). If you cannot do everything a card tells you to do, you do as much as you can; you can still play a card even if you know you will not be able to do everything it tells you to.

Some cards give "+1 Action." This increases how many Action cards you can play in a turn. The increase happens right then, but you do not play the next Action card until completely finishing the first one. Some cards give "+2 Actions"; that means you can play two more Action cards that turn.

So, for example, if you play Militia, which does not give +Actions, you resolve Militia and are done with your Action phase. But you could instead play a Market, then another Market, then a Militia; each Market gives you +1 Action, which lets you keep playing Actions.

Using up your Actions is optional; you can have an Action card left in hand that you can play, and decide not to play it.

First you can play any number of Treasure cards from your hand, in any order. Treasure cards say "Treasure" on the bottom and have a yellow banner. You play one by moving it to the "in play" area; you probably will not announce your Treasures, though you can if you want. The Treasures have no text, just a big coin with a number on it. You get that many coins to spend this turn - one coin for a Copper, two for a Silver, three for a Gold, indicated as Treasures. You do not have to play every Treasure in your hand (but only get you play).

Then, you can buy one card, costing as much corner of cards. You buy a card by choosing it from the Supply, and then "gaining" it. "Gaining" a card means moving it from the Supply to your discard pile. Your total amount of coins available to spend goes down by the cost of the card. For example if you played four Coppers and a Silver, that makes total; if you bought a Market, that costs and have

Take all of the cards you have in play (both Actions and Treasures), and any remaining cards in your hand, and put them all into your discard pile. The order does not matter; you can hide the cards from your hand under the played cards if you want to.

Every card has types, listed on the bottom; a color, which helps indicate certain types; and a cost, in the lower left corner. Action cards all have a text box with instructions; sometimes other cards do.

Cards can have multiple types. A card has all of its types for all purposes. For example, Throne Room lets you play an Action card twice; that Action could be Witch, which is an Action - Attack, or Moat, an Action - Reaction, or Smithy, an Action.

These are the card types present in the main set (expansions add some): • Action: These can be played in your Action phase to do what they say to do in the text box. • Treasure: These can be played in your Buy phase to produce indicated in the top corners and on a big like Action cards. • Victory: These are generally not useful during the game, but are worth number next to a big • Curse: These are bad cards worth -1 them, though you can; however you may receive them from other players via Witch. • Attack: These are cards that hurt other players directly somehow. • Reaction: These are cards that can be used in some way at an unusual time. Any such use is spelled out on the Reaction card; for example Moat says it can be revealed when another player plays an Attack card. Reactions are used one at a time (which matters for expansion Reactions).

Some special terms are used in card text.

Four terms involve a number after a + symbol. +2 is the same as +1 twice, and so on.

"+1 Action" - You may play an additional Action card this turn. • When this happens, it just adds to the number of Action cards you can play; you finish resolving the current card before actually playing more Action cards. • Actions are only usable in the Action phase. • When you have multiple Actions, it can be helpful to say the number out loud to remember it. Some players like to form a "tree" on the table, putting two played Actions on a Village or Festival to show its Actions being used up.

"+1 Buy" - You may buy an additional card in your Buy phase this turn. • You do not have to use extra Buys. • You split up your

## Among Your Buys.

"+1 Card" - Draw a card. • You draw the card immediately. • If you have to draw more cards than are left in your deck, you shuffle your discard pile, put it under your deck, and then draw. If there still are not enough cards to draw, you just draw as many as you can.

"+ " - You have an extra • +

to spend in your Buy phase this turn.

does not give you a Copper card; it just adds to how much

you can spend this turn.

Other terms involve moving cards, seeing cards, and where cards are.

"Discard a card" - Move a card from your hand to your discard pile. • Sometimes a card will tell you to discard a card from another location, but by default discarded cards come from hands. • You place the discarded card on top of your discard pile, face up. • If you discard multiple cards at once, you do not need to reveal them all, just the one you put on top.

"Gain a card" - Take a card from the Supply and put it into your discard pile. • Sometimes a card will let you gain a card from a place other than the Supply, but by default gained cards come from the Supply. • Sometimes a card will let you gain a card to a location other than your discard pile, but by default all gained cards are put into your discard pile. • You do not play a card when you gain it; it just goes to your discard pile.

"In play" - Being in a player's play area. • Cards become "in play" when played, and usually stay there until discarded from play in Clean-up. • Only played cards are in play; set aside cards, cards in the trash, in the Supply, in hands, etc., are not in play.

## Dominionrules.Qxp_Widedominion // : Am Page 

"Look at a card" - You get to see the card; other players do not. • After looking at it, return it to wherever it was (unless otherwise instructed).

"Play a card" - Put a card into play, and follow the instructions on it. • When a card tells you to play a card, that does not use up an Action play for the turn. • As with playing a card normally, you follow the instructions in order, stopping at a dividing line when there is one. • As always, played cards go into play, not directly into the discard pile.

"Reveal a card" - All players get to see the card. • After revealing it, return it to wherever it was (unless otherwise instructed).

"Set aside a card" - Put the card on the table, outside of the play area. • Set aside cards are not "in play." • Set aside cards are face up unless otherwise specified. • A card that sets a card aside will say when to move it somewhere else.

"Trash a card" - Put a card into the Trash pile. • This is a way of getting rid of a card; a trashed card is no longer one of your cards. • The Trash pile is on the Trash mat, face up; players may look through the Trash at any time. • The order of the Trash pile does not matter; players can reorder it. • Cards in the Trash are essentially out of the game, though some expansion cards can get them.

Finally there are three symbols used in text boxes.

- Victory points. The player with the most

## Wins.

- The coin symbol. This indicates costs of cards, and amounts of money produced.

Dividing line - Some cards have the text box divided with a line (e.g. Moat). This separates abilities that happen at different times. When playing the card, you follow instructions above the line only; the text below the line will say when it applies.

If you have to do anything with your deck - for example draw, look at, reveal, set aside, discard, or trash cards - and you need more cards than are left in your deck, first shuffle your discard pile and put it under your deck, then do the thing. If there are still not enough cards, you do the thing with however many cards you can. If when shuffling there are no cards in your deck, the shuffled discard pile simply becomes your new deck.

When your deck is empty, you do not shuffle until you need to do something with cards from your deck. If you have to put a card on top of your deck when it is empty, that card becomes the only card in your deck.

## Dominionrules.Qxp_Widedominion // : Am Page 

You can count the number of cards in your deck at any time (without looking at the card fronts), but cannot look through or count your discard pile or another player's deck or discard pile. The number of cards in each player's hand is public, as is the top card of each discard pile. All cards in play are public; set aside cards are normally public but are sometimes face down. Players can look through the Trash pile at any time.

When interacting with a discard pile (e.g. with Harbinger), it is not necessary to keep it in the same order. The only thing that ever matters about that order is that the top card is public. It is also never necessary to keep the Trash pile in a particular order.

When two things happen to different players at the same time, go in turn order starting with the player whose turn it is. For example, when a player plays Witch, the other players gain Curses in turn order, which may matter if the Curses run out.

When two things happen to one player at the same time, that player picks the order to do them, even if some are mandatory and some are not. This can come up with expansions.

When a card gives you a choice ("choose one..."), you can pick any option, without considering whether or not you will be able to do it. This comes up with expansions.

To play with 5 or 6 players, you need additional base cards. These are available in the Base Cards product and in the Big Box, or you could have two copies of Dominion.

Most Victory piles still have 12 cards, as with 3-4 player games. However use 15 Provinces for 5 players, and use 18 Provinces for 6 players. Use 40 Curses for 5 players, 50 Curses for 6 players.

## Add All Of The Extra Coppers, Silvers, And Golds To Those Piles.

The game end condition for 5-6 players is: any four piles are empty, or the Province pile is empty.

e m a g e h t

## E R O F E B

Shuffle your starting 10 cards (7 Coppers & 3 Estates) and place them face-down as your deck. Draw the top 5 cards as your starting hand. In this example, you have 1 Estate & 4 Coppers. The rest remain as your deck.

Then each other player, in turn order, reveals their top 2 cards, trashes one they choose that is a Treasure other than Copper (e.g. Silver or Gold), and discards the other revealed cards. A player who did not reveal a Treasure card other than Copper simply discards both cards.

Bureaucrat: A player with no cards in their deck will have the card they put on top become the only card in their deck.

Cellar: Choose any number of cards from your hand; discard them all at once; then draw as many cards as you actually discarded. If this causes you to shuffle, you will shuffle in the cards you discarded. You do not have to let players see any but the top card discarded; however the number of cards you discard is public.

Moat stays in your hand, and can still be played on your next turn. Moat does not stop anything an Attack does to other players, or for the player who played it; it just protects you personally. Moat can also be played on your turn for +2 Cards. If multiple Attacks are played on a turn or in a round of turns, you may reveal Moat for as many of them as you want.

Remodel: You cannot trash the Remodel itself, since it is not in your hand after you play it. If you do not have a card to trash, you do not gain one. If you do gain a card, it comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. The gained card does not need to cost exactly much or less, and can even be another copy of the trashed card. You cannot use

more than the trashed card; it can cost that

to increase how expensive of a card you gain.

Sentry: First you draw a card and get +1 Action. Then you look at the top 2 cards of your deck. You can trash both, or discard both, or put both back in either order; or you can trash one and discard one, or trash one and put one back, or discard one and put one back.

Smithy: You draw 3 cards.

Throne Room: Playing an Action card from your hand is optional. If you do play one, you resolve it completely, then play it a second time. You cannot play other cards in-between (unless told to by the card, such as with Vassal or Throne Room itself). Playing Action cards with Throne Room is just like playing Action cards normally, except it does not use up Action plays for the turn. For example if you start a turn by playing Throne Room on Village, you would draw a card, get +2 Actions, draw another card, and get +2 Actions again, leaving you with 4 Actions. If you Throne Room a Throne Room, you may play an Action card twice, then may play another Action card twice; you do not play one Action card four times.

Vassal: If the card is an Action card, you can play it, but do not have to. If you do play it, you move it into your play area and follow its instructions; this does not use up one of your Action plays for the turn.

Village: You draw a card and get +2 Actions.

Witch: The Curses come from the Supply and are put into discard piles. They are given out in turn order, which can matter when the Curse pile is low. When the Curses are gone, you can still play Witch for +2 Cards.

Workshop: The card you gain comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. You cannot use . always costs from
