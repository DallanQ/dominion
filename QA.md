[set-up](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2080101/set-up)

> How many Copper, Silver and Gold do we start with in the base game?

Each player's starting deck has 7 Copper and 3 Estates. The supply starts with all of the Gold (30), Silver (40), and whatever Copper was not dealt to players. The Copper deck starts with 60, so in a 2-player game, the supply will have 46 Copper.

> Once an action is played, the card may not be played again, correct?

The cards stays in front of you and only gets put back in the discards after you are done, so no, you cannot play the same physical card twice. 

Any Action cards you've used move to your discard pile during the Clean-up phase, and you'll eventually shuffle and draw them back into your hand in future turns. However, some special cards, like Throne Room, allow you to replay an Action card immediately, effectively letting you play the chosen Action twice on the same turn. But without such an effect, each Action card is a one-time use per turn.

[can-you-reveal-a-reaction-twice](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/492682/can-you-reveal-a-reaction-twice)

> Can you reveal a Reaction card twice in reaction to the same Attack? if so, can it be the same copy of the card?

You can reveal a reaction as many times as you like. Normally you only do it once, but in the case of drawing a Moat due to a Secret Chamber, you can play the SC again if you really wanted to.

[tactician-rules-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/524361/tactician-rules-question)

> does playing the Tactician mean that your turn ends (skipping ahead to the cleanup phase)
> or does it simply make you discard your hand?

Playing the Tactician does not end your turn immediately; it simply requires you to discard your hand as part of its effect. You continue with the rest of your turn as usual, meaning you can still play additional Action cards if you have them available (for instance, if you have extra Actions from a previous card) and buy cards in the Buy phase.

[are-actions-granted-from-kingdom-cards-optional](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/353764/are-actions-granted-from-kingdom-cards-optional)

> The rules state that the initial play of an action card is optional. Does that mean if you play an action card that gives you +2 actions (Village) and you have 2 actions in hand, you must play them both? 
> Or do these gained actions continue to be optional?

The actions are optional. If you use them, the order is specified by the card. For example, the Laboratory gives you +2 cards and +1 action. The two cards must be drawn before you take the action. You can't draw the first card, take your action, and then draw the second card #1.

[a-few-questions-regarding-dominion-base-version](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/743472/a-few-questions-regarding-dominion-base-version)

> Are the phases, Action, Buy and Clean-up separated? I.e. do you finish playing all your action cards and then go to Buy phase or do you finish resolving?

The phases are separate. You resolve everything on one Action card before playing another. Only when you have finished playing Action cards do you move on to the Buy phase.

> Does playing a Workshop action card use up your buy in the Buy phase?

No - you Gain a card there and then. (Note that many of the terms used on cards, including Gain, have specific meanings defined in the rules.)

> If you don't have any Treasure cards on your hand, do you still get to buy Kingdom cards with the coins provided by playing action cards, e.g. Market +1 coin?

Yes. The number of coins that you can spend is the total number of coins generated by cards that you have played, including Action cards and Treasure cards (played in your Action and Buy phases respectively).

> Is it allowed to spend extra buys in the Buy phase to get Coppers?

Yes, you may buy cards up to the number of buys you have (1 per turn, plus any from Action cards), and up to the number of coins you have. Since Copper costs 0, you can always use spare buys. Of course, this may not be a good idea, since if your hand has a lot of Coppers it is less likely to generate enough coins for a higher value card than if you have Silver or Gold.

> Throne room: if a you choose a Market as the action to play twice, do you (draw 1 card, do extra action and then buy with +1 coin) x2 or is it (draw 2 cards, perform 2 actions and then +2 buy with +2 coins)?

It is the former - you do everthing on the card once and then do it once again. Of course, with Market it doesn't make any real difference since drawing a card is the only thing that "happens" while resolving the card - the other elements all add to the number of things that you can do afterward.

> Spy: Does each player decide what to do with their revealed card or does the player who played the Spy decide?

The person playing the card. In general, when the card text says "you" or "your" it means the person who played the card

[remodel-card-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1845256/remodel-card-question)

> When you trash a card from your hand, does it have to be an Action card, or can it be any type? Additionally, when you purchase a replacement card, can it be any card type, such as a Treasure or Victory card?

It depends on what is causing you to trash the card. Most cards say "Trash a card from your hand" so it can be any card.

2.1. With the Throne Room (B), you'll choose an action card and play it twice. You choose Moat. You play Moat once and draw 2 cards, e.g., two Estates.
2.2. Now, you play Moat a second time and draw 2 more cards: an Estate and a Witch.
3. Now you play Throne Room (B) a second time. You'll choose an action card and play it twice. You choose Witch.
3.1. You play Witch once. You draw two cards and each opponent gets a Curse.
3.2. You play Witch a second time. You draw two cards and each opponent gets a Curse.

> In a two-player game, 10 Curses are set out. What happens when the pile of Curses disappear and someone plays another Witch?

Once the curses run out, there is no more curses left in the supply, and it's treated the same as any other empty pile. Playing another Witch will allow you to draw 2 new cards, but no more curses can be given out.

> If you just keep on playing without Curses, then does the Curse pile being empty count towards the 3 empty pile end of game condition?

Yes, it will count toward the 3 empty pile rule.

You can always play the card. Sometimes it just doesn't do anything.

But if you have already played all your actions for the turn, you cannot use a Throne card to play any more actions and also When the Throne Card is trashed or gained by another player during your turn, you can't use it anymore.

>  When a card effect like Harbinger lets you place a card “onto your deck,” does this mean to place it on top of the deck to draw next, or to shuffle it into the deck?

It means place it on top of your deck. And yes, playing another Action cards that draws a card (e.g. another Harbinger) will then draw that card. This will generally be clarified in the Kingdom Card Notes section of the rule book for the card in question.

When an effect tells you to place a card "onto your deck," it means that you should place that card on top of your draw pile (the deck from which you draw cards). 

[game-end](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/350881/game-end)

You count all victory points in your deck, hand, and discard pile

> Is the Militia considered an "Attack" card, such that the Moat can be used to defend against it?

Militia is considered an "Attack" card, so the Moat can indeed be used to defend against it

> How do Curse cards come into play? They're not used with the base set of ten cards, correct?

Curse cards come into play when specific Kingdom cards require them, such as Witch, Young Witch. There not used with base set of ten supply cards but are added when a card that gives out Curses is used in the game.

> Is there ever a situation where you would want to buy a Curse card for yourself?

Yes, but you would have to be out of Copper cards (also 0 cost but 0 vp) for this to matter, and there are a ton of those.

If you're in a game where your opponents are likely to gain Curses and you can acquire one to prevent them from gaining it (like through certain card effects), it could be a tactical move.

Yes, you choose what coin cards to play. If they are still in your hand, they are not in play.

 If you have Contraband in your hand but already have enough money from other cards to buy what you want, you are not forced to play it.

Loan is for trashing Copper. But it also gives you a temporary boost to your purchasing power this round.

[behavior-order](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2395614/behavior-order)

> If I play an action phase and the placed card says +1 action and +1 buy then, what is the order of my behaviors next?

+1 Action allows you to play another Action card during your Action phase, but you do not have to use that Action immediately. This flexibility can be crucial for chaining multiple Actions together effectively, especially when using cards like Village that grant additional Actions.

You cannot move to the Buy phase or purchase cards until you have completed your Action phase, regardless of how many Actions or Buys you have. Only after resolving all your Actions can you then buy cards according to the number of Buys available to you.

> The rule states that I can play the Moat card as an Action during my turn to draw two cards, but if I reveal it as a Reaction when attacked, do I still draw two cards?
> What happens if I play as the first player thous playing Moat, and the second player plays Witch, does Moat still count as a reaction?

If you reveal Moat as a Reaction to an attack, you do not draw two cards. Revealing Moat allows you to ignore the effects of the attack, but you only draw two cards when you play Moat as an Action during your own turn.

> If you have multiple Action - Reaction cards in your hand when someone plays an attack card, can you play more than on against one attack?

Absolutely. For example, the following play sequence is legal:
- Player A plays an Attack card.
- Player B, who does not have a Moat card in his hand, reveals Secret Chamber and draws 2 cards. One of those cards is a Moat.
- Player B puts 2 cards, not including the Moat he just drew, back on top of his deck.
- Player B now reveals the Moat in his hand, and is unaffected by the attack.
That play sequence would be appropriate, by the way, even if player B had already had the Moat in his hand before revealing the Secret Chamber.

> Why are there 24 estate cards when i only use up to 12 of them?

You start with 3 in your hand to begin the game... times the number of players (max 4) = 12 extras.

>  what is the goal of the 7 blank cards?

The blanks can be used to replace damaged/lost cards. I use them to represent an empty pile of supply cards during the game as the white stands out and is a great reminder.

blank cards is to use them as a method of handicapping. Simply replace one or more coppers in the starting deck with blank cards and you've made the deck significantly weaker.

the Embargo token only triggers when a player buys a card from the pile it’s on. So, if you put an Embargo token on the Curse pile, it won’t affect curses given by effects like the Witch card.
