[set-up](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2080101/set-up)

> How many Copper, Silver and Gold do we start with in the base game?

The supply starts with all of the Gold (30), Silver (40), and whatever Copper was not dealt to players. The Copper deck starts with 60, so in a 2-player game, the supply will have 46 Copper.

> Once an action is played, the card may not be played again, correct?

The cards stays in front of you and only gets put back in the discards after you are done, so no, you cannot play the same physical card twice. 

Any Action cards you've used move to your discard pile during the Clean-up phase, and you'll eventually shuffle and draw them back into your hand in future turns. However, some special cards, like Throne Room, allow you to replay an Action card immediately, effectively letting you play the chosen Action twice on the same turn. But without such an effect, each Action card is a one-time use per turn.

[can-you-reveal-a-reaction-twice](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/492682/can-you-reveal-a-reaction-twice)

> Can you reveal a Reaction card twice in reaction to the same Attack? if so, can it be the same copy of the card?

You can't reveal one reaction card multiple times on an attack.

You cannot reveal the same copy of a Reaction card multiple times in response to the same Attack. Once you reveal a Reaction card, like Secret Chamber, to respond to an Attack, that specific copy has already been used for that Attack and cannot be revealed again in response to the same event

[tactician-rules-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/524361/tactician-rules-question)

> does playing the Tactician mean that your turn ends (skipping ahead to the cleanup phase)
> or does it simply make you discard your hand?

Tactician says you discard your hand, so you discard your hand, but it does not say to end your turn immediately, so you do not end your turn immediately.

Playing the Tactician does not end your turn immediately; it simply requires you to discard your hand as part of its effect. You continue with the rest of your turn as usual, meaning you can still play additional Action cards if you have them available (for instance, if you have extra Actions from a previous card) and buy cards in the Buy phase.

[are-actions-granted-from-kingdom-cards-optional](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/353764/are-actions-granted-from-kingdom-cards-optional)

> 1. The rules state that the initial play of an action card is optional. Does that mean if you play an action card that gives you +2 actions (Village) and you have 2 actions in hand, you must play them both? 
> 2. Or do these gained actions continue to be optional?

The actions are optional. If you use them, the order is specified by the card. For example, the Laboratory gives you +2 cards and +1 action. The two cards must be drawn before you take the action. You can't draw the first card, take your action, and then draw the second card #1.

[a-few-questions-regarding-dominion-base-version](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/743472/a-few-questions-regarding-dominion-base-version)

> Are the phases, Action, Buy and Clean-up separated? I.e. do you finish playing all your action cards and then go to Buy phase or do you finish resolving?

The phases are separate. You resolve everything on one Action card before playing another. Only when you have finished playing Action cards do you move on to the Buy phase.

> If you don't have any Treasure cards on your hand, do you still get to buy Kingdom cards with the coins provided by playing action cards, e.g. Market +1 coin?

Yes. The number of coins that you can spend is the total number of coins generated by cards that you have played, including Action cards and Treasure cards (played in your Action and Buy phases respectively).

> Is it allowed to spend extra buys in the Buy phase to get Coppers?

Yes, you may buy cards up to the number of buys you have (1 per turn, plus any from Action cards), and up to the number of coins you have. Since Copper costs 0, you can always use spare buys. Of course, this may not be a good idea, since if your hand has a lot of Coppers it is less likely to generate enough coins for a higher value card than if you have Silver or Gold.

> Throne room: if a you choose a Market as the action to play twice, do you (draw 1 card, do extra action and then buy with +1 coin) x2 or is it (draw 2 cards, perform 2 actions and then +2 buy with +2 coins)?

It is the former - you do everthing on the card once and then do it once again. Of course, with Market it doesn't make any real difference since drawing a card is the only thing that "happens" while resolving the card - the other elements all add to the number of things that you can do afterward.

> Spy: Does each player decide what to do with their revealed card or does the player who played the Spy decide?

The person playing the card. In general, when the card text says "you" or "your" it means the person who played the card

[remodel-card-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1845256/remodel-card-question)

> When you trash a card from your hand, does it have to be an Action card, or can it be any type? Additionally, when you purchase a replacement card, can it be any card type, such as a Treasure or Victory card?

It depends on what is causing you to trash the card. Most cards say "Trash a card from your hand" so it can be any card. However, Death Cart from the Dark Ages expansion specifically says you must trash an action card. Same for the Advance event card from Empires, it says trash an action card.

> With this cards Throne Room, Throne Room, Moat, Copper, Copper How does chaining multiple Throne Room and King's Court cards work?

1. You play a card: Throne Room (A).
2. With the Throne Room (A), you'll choose an action card and play it twice. You choose Throne Room (B).
   1. With the Throne Room (B), you'll choose an action card and play it twice. You choose Moat. You play Moat once and draw 2 cards, e.g., two Estates.
   2. Now, you play Moat a second time and draw 2 more cards: an Estate and a Witch.
3. Now you play Throne Room (B) a second time. You'll choose an action card and play it twice. You choose Witch.
   1. You play Witch once. You draw two cards and each opponent gets a Curse.
   2. You play Witch a second time. You draw two cards and each opponent gets a Curse.

[question-about-curses](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1015628/question-about-curses)

> In a two-player game, 10 Curses are set out. What happens when the pile of Curses disappear and someone plays another Witch?

Once the curses run out, there is no more curses left in the supply, and it's treated the same as any other empty pile. Playing another Witch will allow you to draw 2 new cards, but no more curses can be given out.

> If you just keep on playing without Curses, then does the Curse pile being empty count towards the 3 empty pile end of game condition?

Yes. Unless a card specifically says that it's "not in the supply" (which you don't run into outside of the Cornucopia and Dark Ages expansions), it will count toward the 3 empty pile rule.

[remodeling-a-curse-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/357791/remodeling-a-curse-card)

> Having accumulated a lot of curse cards, and on hands where i had no other play, do I have to take a card worth 2?

You must take a card that costs 2 or less if it's available, such as a Copper or a Curse, and any card you remodel to cost 2 can be further remodeled later for something more useful

> What are some cases where a Throne card would not be allowed?

If you have already played all your actions for the turn, you cannot use a Throne card to play any more actions and also When the Throne Card is trashed or gained by another player during your turn, you can't use it anymore.
